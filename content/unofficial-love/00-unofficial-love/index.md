"I love you!"

On that day, I shouted my feelings in front of her. At the night of December
24th, the day before Christmas.

She is quiet.

I'm waiting for her reaction, didn't know what to do.

I looked at her, she's still quiet.

I looked at the lamp above, ahh... my eyes, it's too glaring.

After almost blind I looked at the window besides me, I saw a creepy reflection.

Is it just my imagination after almost blind?

Oh, it's just my reflection.

After scared of my own face, I'm back to reality. I must do something in this
awkward mood. Let's use knowledge from all of my romance manga that I read. what
usually happen after confession?

From what I read, most of the time the confession is failed with many accident.
So, my knowledge is useless now.

Is she quiet because of scared of my face? Me too.

Suddenly, she looked at her phone.

"Sorry, I have to go"

Then she ran to the side of road and entered the car that stopped in front of
her.

I only see her from a distance. After that I went home with complicated feeling.

In my room, I lay on the bed and thinking.

"Huh...am I rejected?"

Then my phone is vibrating, I get chat notification from her.

I see the time, it's almost midnight.

I opened it with a doubt in my heart.

"I'm happy with your confession. I also have the same feeling."

Suddenly my heart is beating so fast. I try to read the rest of the chat but I'm
afraid if suddenlt I get heart attack and die.

"Bu, can you wait until I graduate? Then we can be official couple"

I read that and I didn't know how I feel.

Huh...

"Okay"

I only replied it to her.

I'm confused. So, what kind of our relationship we are now?

Friends?

Couple?

Sibling? (Okay, this is impossible).

She mentioned about 'official couple' before, so are we 'unofficial couple'?

Is this some kind of 'unofficial love'?
