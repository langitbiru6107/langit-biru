"I love you!"

On that day, I shouted my feelings in front of her. At the night of December
24th, the day before Christmas.

She is quiet.

I'm waiting for her reaction, didn't know what to do.

I looked at her, she's still quiet.

I looked at the lamp above, ahh... my eyes, it's too glaring.

After almost blind, I looked at the window besides me and I saw a creepy
reflection.

Is it just my imagination after almost blind?

I try to clean my eyes. Oh, it's just my reflection.

After scared of my own reflection, I looked back at her. Is she quiet because of
scared of my face?

I should do something in this awkward mood. Let's use knowledge from all of my
romance manga that I have read.

What usually happened after confession?

Then I remember, most of romance comedy never have any confession scene. If
there's any, it either failed then back to zero or success then it finished in
next chapter.

Damn, I just hope there's suddenly alien invasion to failed my confession.

Back to reality.

Suddenly, she looked at her phone.

"Sorry, I have to go"

Then she ran to the side of road and entered the car that stopped in front of
her.

I only see her from a distance. After that I went home with complicated feeling.

In my room, I lay on the bed and thinking.

"Huh...am I rejected?"

Then my phone is vibrating, I get chat notification from her.

I see the time, it's almost midnight.

I opened it with a doubt in my heart.

"I'm happy with your confession. I also have the same feeling."

My heart is beating so fast. I try to read the rest of the chat but I'm afraid
if suddenly I get heart attack and die.

"But, can you wait until I graduate? Then we can be official couple"

Huh...

I read that and I didn't know how I feel.

"Okay"

I only replied it to her.

I'm confused. So, what kind of our relationship we are now?

Friends?

Couple?

Sibling? (Okay, this is impossible).

She mentioned about 'official couple' before, so are we 'unofficial couple'?

Is this some kind of 'unofficial love'?
