I'm sitting in front of her while she is talking about something. I remember
this conversation, it's before I confess last night.

I looked around, it's night time.

I feel...

Déjà vu.

I've just been in this place before.

Higher on the... okay it's another song, not part of this story.

"Am I travel back to last night before confession?", I thought.

Is this some kind of endless eight?

Is this some kind of loop and I can't get out from it unless my confession is
accepted?

How many iteration have been happened?

I'm confused. I thought this story should only be slice of life.

Okay, if I travel time back to last night so what happen after this is my
confession to her.

I called her name.

"Yes?", she replied.

I looked at her beautiful face.

My heart beat so fast even this is my second confession to her.

"I lo..."

Suddenly there's fireworks to failed my confession. Really? Am I in the romance
comedy manga now?

So in this iteration I failed to confess.

I looked at the sky to watched the fireworks, then I realized it's not
fireworks. There's some flying object at the sky shooting something like
fireworks.

Is that UFO?

Is this alien invasion?

Is this story still slice of life?

Then that UFO shoot the fireworks to us.

And everything become white.

...

Suddenly I wake up from my sleep.

"It's just a dream"

I looked at my phone and see what day is today. It's December 25th.

So I have weird dream after confession last night.

I dont have any energy to get up from my bed, my body is freezing.

I looked outside from my windows. It's snow... at christmas day.

So it's white christmas, what a beautiful day. But I choose to sleep again in
this cold weather.

Wait, I live in tropical country. Why is there snow fall?

I looked at the sky and suddenly there's UFO shoots fireworks to me.

Not this again.

...

I wake up again.

I check outside window, there is no snow. I look at the sky, there is no UFO
with fireworks shooter. I try to punch my head to wall to confirm this is not
a dream again.

It hurts.

Okay this is not a dream. And I hope this story is still slice of life after two
weird dreams happen.

I check my phone, today is December 25th and there's still chat from her from
last night.

So the replied from her via chat last night is a reality.

I choose to sleep again because today is holiday.

I hope there is not weird dream again in this sleep.
