So, as you can see, I write a story in
[previous post](/unofficial-love/00-unofficial-love/). At first, this website
only will be host for my fictional story, but at the end I decide to make this
website as a blog and host for my story.

Currently the spacing is so shitty, but I already fix it in another branch. I
will deploy it tomorrow with another fix. I also want to split the routing
between regular post and story. Maybe I'll add navigation link in header and
breadcrumb to easy access.

Last, I know my english is not good because I'm not native. So, maybe somebody
in the future will see my story and want to help to fix my shitty grammar.
Probably I also want to translate it to my native language. I hope so!
