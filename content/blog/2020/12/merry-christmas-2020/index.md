Merry Christmas to anyone celebrating!

I myself don't celebrate christmas, so this day is free holiday for me. Also
there is no snow in my country. I'm afraid climate change has gone too far if
there's snow in my country, because I live in tropical country.

Last few days I've been developed this blog. Now there are navigation on the top
and new page for updates. I will continue to write
[Unofficial Love](/unofficial-love) story today or tomorrow.

Happy Padoru!
